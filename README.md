This project represents project 5 of openclassroom. I spent several weeks developing a php blog respecting the different possible conventions in order to provide correctly designed code. From the implementation of an in-house MVC architecture to the design, respecting the different PSRs, this project allowed me to increase my skills in the field of web development.
Without further ado, here is how to install the project:
--first point clone the project at: https://github.com/hacene92230/p5-blogphp.git
--second point: take the file named "p5.sql" from the "www" folder and import it into your database.
--third point made a composer install to install all the necessary dependencies.
Here is the installation of the blog should have succeeded.
